# student-survey
I did this project in my third year, and it was a report based on a survey the cohort had all taken. We were required to propose some hypotheses, and perform the relevant hypothesis tests to see if we had a significant result. The assignment was done in RMarkdown Quarto.

- To view my report, open the html file [Assingment_1_Redo.html](/Assingment_1_Redo.html). To view the code, open [Assingment_1_Redo.qmd](/Assingment_1_Redo.qmd) in RStudio.
